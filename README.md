# Aerial and Maritime Drones
This repository contains lab assignments completed for the Aerial and Maritime Drones course as part of my Master's program in Advanced Robotics at Centrale Nantes.

## Overview

The labs in this repository focus on various topics covered in the course, like control and state estimation for underwater drones, cascaded PD control aerial drone and swarm control for drones.

## Contents

- `underwater_lab/` - Waypoint Following and Pose Estimation using Extented Kalman Filter
- `aerial_control_lab/` - Stabilized flight of a quadrotor using a cascaded PD control law
- `aerial_swarm_lab/` - Implementation of Olfati-Saberâ€™s flocking algorithm for distributed multi-agent systems in a simplified 2D scenario

## Visuals

Below are some key visuals from the lab assignments, including plots, diagrams, or screenshots to illustrate the results and methodologies.

## How to Use

This repository is for showcasing purposes. To explore the code and reports:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioloizou/aerial-and-maritime-drones.git
```

Feel free to browse through each lab folder to view the detailed documentation and code for each assignment. If you don't have the university VM you will not be able to run it as you will be missing many dependecies.
